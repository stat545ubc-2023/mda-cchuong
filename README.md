# STAT 545A Mini Data-Analysis Project

This is the repository for the mini data-analysis project for STAT 545A, completed by Christine Chuong. 

The purpose of this project is to practice familiarizing yourself with data, forming research questions, and using various summarising, manipulating and plotting methods to answer these questions. This project also explores tidy data and creating clear reproducible reports in R Markdown.

To interact with this repository, you can:
* Clone this repository onto your computer and work on the files locally or,
* Copy and paste the contents of Mini Data-Analysis Milestone 1.Rmd into an empty R Markdown script and run that.

All the datasets used in this project can be found in the `datateachr` package in R, so there are no external data files you need to run the project. Instructions for installing the `datateachr` package are included in "Mini Data-Analysis Milestone 1.Rmd", but if you have never used it before, you should also install the `tidyverse` package, which contains multiple packages used in this project, including `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.
